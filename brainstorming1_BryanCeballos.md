Discord

- The sidebar that holds all of the servers you are in has multiple ways and levels to organize them so that you know exactly where to go when you want a specific server
- There's also a separate sidebar that holds group chats as well as individual chats with others which is more convenient if you chat more with individuals
- The settings page has a search bar that allows you to sort through the custom settings and keybinds that discord offers

YouTube

- The sidebar that lies under the settings bar shows the youtube channels that I follow, and allows me to browse them without going to a different page.
- The queue system also allows the videos to be displayed in a different window, which allows you to search for more videos to add to the queue, without stopping the original video.
- The segmentation of features on their settings bar makes it really easy to switch between normal youtube videos, posts, and reels.

Crunchyroll

- There is a big window that always changes depending on the news for anything in the community or new shows that are coming out.
- When voting for certain awards starts, it gets advertised throughout the whole site, but not in a way that disturbs the user.
- There are multiple types of lists that you can make in order to organize shows you've watched, plan on watching, or finished.
